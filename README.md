# hello-world

following the github tutorial for new users

I haven't used GitHub enough to have any idea what I'm doing right now. I like the systematic approach to updates so far, but I'm vaguely concerned that my in-browser spellcheck doesn't appear to apply here, which means there may be some hilarious failures in these files.
The tutorial said to put something about myself in here, and the example image had something about a robot's experience with moon-tacos, so I'll just say that I'm a biological, terrestrial organism to the best of my knowledge. I like a lot of different kinds of food. I find the difference between similar pastries made in France to those made in Japan interesting.
